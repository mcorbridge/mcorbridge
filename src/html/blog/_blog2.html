<!--
dependencies: _blog.scss, BlogData.js, BlogTopic.js

Why do I do it this way?
Good question.  First, the blog data (title, date, abstract, content) is kept separate from the view.  That's just basic MVC.
The blog entries are all cookie-cut from this basic template, HOWEVER I retain the right to add different elements. For
example, what if I wanted to add an image, or a span containing sample code, or an embedded CodePen (or Fiddle) ... or some other thing
I have yet to imagine?  If I do indeed find a need for this in the future, then I have the flexibility to add it.

<div class=blogItem ng-click=doBlogClick()>
	<div class="blogItemTitle" ng-bind="blogTitle"></div>
	<div class="blogItemDate" ng-bind="blogDate"></div>
	<div class="blogItemAbstract" ng-bind="blogAbstract"></div>
</div>
